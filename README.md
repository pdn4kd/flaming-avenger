Raptop Ascent Program

An ascent simulator for testing designs in Kerbal Space Program 0.10.1 - 0.90. This program is explicitly not bug-compatible with the Unity implimentation (for starters this uses spherical coordinates instead of rectangular), but is nonetheless usefully accurate.


Stage split

finding how to distribute tankage between 2 stages, if you know the other parameters (engines, payload, miscellanious bits) of a rocket. Analytic, but finicky. Given actual KSP parts, upper stages will tend towards low TWR. This may be acceptable for larger landers, but is not useful in carrier rockets.
